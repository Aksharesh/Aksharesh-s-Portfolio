## WORK EXPERIENCE
### Technical Assistant (Civil Engineer)
**Water and Sanitation Management Organization, India**

* I worked for an urban planning water supply scheme of the central government involves various responsibilities and tasks that are critical to ensuring the efficient and effective implementation of the project. One of the primary responsibilities is to inspect the work executed on the field, which involves visiting the construction sites, analyzing the progress, and identifying any discrepancies or issues that need to be addressed.

* Another crucial task is to prepare Detailed Project Reports (DPR) for water supply schemes. This involves conducting extensive research, analyzing data, and creating a comprehensive report that outlines the project's goals, timelines, budget, and technical specifications. The DPR is then submitted to higher authorities such as the Unit Manager, Executive Engineer, and District Magistrate for approval.

* Preparing applications for DPR to get sanctioned is another important responsibility. This requires creating detailed documentation outlining the project's objectives, budget, timelines, and expected outcomes. The application is then submitted to the relevant authorities for review and approval.

* Additionally, the job also involved preparing a tender for the approved schemes and making it ready to get published. This involves creating a comprehensive document that outlines the technical specifications, timelines, and budget of the project. The tender is then published, and contractors are invited to bid for the project.

* Lastly, successfully achieving the tasks within the given timeline is a critical aspect of the job. This requires effective time management skills, and the ability to work collaboratively with contractors to ensure that the project is completed within the allocated timeframe. Overall, working for an urban planning water supply scheme of the central government requires a combination of technical expertise, project management skills, and a strong commitment to delivering high-quality outcomes.
